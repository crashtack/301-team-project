# User Stories:

- As a user Ed, a long time resident who is retired and has lots of time on his hands, would like to be able to look up building permits from his phone while he is out walking his dog. He'd like to be able to quickly find the records for an address and surrounding area. He would like to have the basic information from the building permit record to be clearly displayed and he would like to be able to click through to view the record on the City of Seattle permitting website.

- As a user Nancy, who is buying her first house would like to be able to view building permits by location so she can get a clear idea of which areas have planned building or renovation projects to help her decide on which areas to search in based on how much building effort and money is being put into a specific community.

- As software developers we would like to use our newly acquired skills to build a tool that uses and outside database, uses libraries like jQuery, Handlebars, Node and Page.js. We will use good practices for Mobile First, SMACCS, agile development, REST and MVC structure. We will use tools such as Waffle.io for project management, adhere to using Staging branch inside of GitHub and keep a strict structure for making sure all team members are pulling from our staging branch at the same time to avoid merge conflicts.

- As software developers we would like to build our project with stretch goals in mind. We would like to implement geolocation so that Ed has an even easier time snooping on his neighborhood.
